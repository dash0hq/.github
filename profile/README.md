## Core Principles

Our work will be guided by core principles:
- **Ease of insight:** Correlation and contextualization of issues require going beyond telemetry silos and isolated dashboards.
- **Ease of use:** Broadly adopting observability beyond expert circles requires a magical user and developer experience and collaboration.
- **Ease of integration:** OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, and open standards are the foundation of modern observability.
- **Ease of installation:** Collecting the right telemetry must be trivial, regardless of your infrastructure or applications.
- **Ease of customization:** Adopting observability to your needs and getting the right information for your team should be straightforward to configure.
- **Ease of cost control:** More data does not guarantee more insight. Getting the right balance between data volume and insight must be intuitive.

## From the Community to the Community

We have created our first little helper for you, which is a service we call [OTelBin](https://www.otelbin.io/). OTelBin
is a web-based tool that aims to simplify the configuration of OpenTelemetry collectors. At [Dash0](https://www.dash0.com), we are committed to
making complex tasks easier, and we think this is what OTelBin offers.
